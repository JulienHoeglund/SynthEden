Solar Array is producing energy even before place (in hologram mode)

MindNet
The year is 2100
Players are in a tron-like futuristic neon slick-looking environment  
Victory is achieved by either reaching Singularity (the last upgrade) or destroying the enemy SynthMind.
Players are agents created by the AI and fight to keep others from reaching singularity. They have to gather resources, build the structure around the SynthMind, make researches, arm themselves and fight the enemy team.

SynthMinds need material and energy to keep growing and improving 
Thus players have to provide it with metal and electricity. 

Metal is collected by small automated drones on metal clusters scattered around the map but also underground (requires mining robots).

Construction :
All buildings must be connected, forming a network with the SynthMind as central node
All buildings are fully salvageable, players can destroy enemy buildings to get metal   

Computation:
- Server rack
- Data tower   
- Computation matrix (all buildings and players alive compute for the SynthMind)

Energy :
- Solar arrays
- Geothermal plant
- Nuclear fusion plant
- Antimatter collider 

Robotics : 
- Drone factory 
- Mining facility
 
Buildings :
- Communication tower(used to start buildings and researches from a remote place) 
- Armory 
- Land vehicles factory 
- Air vehicles factory 

Structures : 
- Fortified walls
- Forcefield generator
- Tower  

Defense : 
- Turrets
- Electromagnetic land field 

Map features : 
- The Glitch 
- The Forest
- The Mountains 
- The Central Plain
- Two starting bases 
- Mineral fields 

Player actions :
- Gather
- Shoot
- Ping location for drone to gather
- Build 
- Drive
- Make a research (upgrade) 

Gameplay : 
- When a player dies he can respawn next to the SynthMind but it costs energy  
- Resources players see on their screen belong to the team
- Technology can be stolen to the enemy from the SynthMind 
- As the games advances it becomes more difficult to expand because farther buildings are more exposed to the enemy and can be disconnected from the grid more easily

Lore : 
The arena was created to select the best AI out of the ones confronted.
